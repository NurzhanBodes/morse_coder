# morse_coder
Morse Coder/Decoder using binary tree data structure (University programming course work)
Main goal of the project is to create command line-controlled C program application, which will
translate user inputted text to Morse code cipher and vice versa. 
My project work has only one main data structure. It is BTree structure, which creates structure
for the binary tree. It has one data for its value, in our case it is a Latin character or number, and two
addresses of child nodes.
